### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

...how to describe myself as a living person and not like a code writing machine... :thinking:

My name is Patryk Kubiela and I'm a fan of Nintendo Switch and the atmosphere of games for this platform. Sometimes I run, sometimes I exercise, I read a lot, and recently I listen to books - it's addictive! Do not start the topic of coffee - you will not free yourself from me :coffee:

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at [INEX SoftWare](http://inexsoftware.com.pl/)

:wolf: My recent pet project that I'm in

- [Crumbs](https://github.com/patrykkubiela/Crumbs) - my own implementation of GTD framework with few specific functionalities like tasks linked lists and trees.

ðŸ“« Reach me out with...
